 -The ability to have auto-completed lines of code increses efficiency.
 
2. Syntax Highlights
 -A program that breaks up certain functions or commands and highlights them different colors greatly increse orginzation.
 
3. Variety of Themes
 -Different theme changes can reduce eye strain and fatigue when faced with long projects.
 
4. Extension Options

 ## Git / GitHub
 
 ### Git
 
 This is what is used to track and store any and all changes made to the code to ensure backups in the event of a failure or accident.
 
 Git is a Version Control System (VCS)
 
 It allows multiple developers to work on/share their code wtih eachother, as well as look at previous versions of the project.
 
 ### GitHub
 This is an online are for Devs to work on or post their code to their team or the world.
 
 To clone a repository from GitHub, you would use the code
 
 `git clone url`
 
 From there you are free to view the files in the repo, as well as change or add files.
 
 Once finished with your changes you will save them with the code block:
 
 `git add filename`
 
 Once completed you need to commit those changes, with a brief message of what you did, to the file using:
 
 `git commit -m "I did a thing."`
 
 You have now commited you code to the prjoect and from here you push it back to GitHub for everyone to see using:
 
 `git push origin master`
 
 **Make Sure you have the most current form of the project before attempting push** 
 
 You can do this by using the code block:
 
 `git pull url`
 
 before you attempt push.
