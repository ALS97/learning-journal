>Lets get this bread.

A growth mindset is one that is open to new ideas and being wrong. It is very hard to expand your learning with outdate techniques or information. In order to ensure a healthy growth mindset I will:
 
 1. Listen and respond to constructive criticism.
 
 2. Actively ask questions when they arise.
 
 3. Be present in the learning environment.
