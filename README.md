My name is Austin Smith and at the time of writing this I am 22 years old and starting to learn to code.

### Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is one that is open to new ideas and being wrong. It is very hard to expand your learning with outdate techniques or information. In order to ensure a healthy growth mindset I will:
 
 1. Listen and respond to constructive criticism.
 2. Actively ask questions when they arise.
 3. Be present in the learning environment.
